Welcome!

This is the LUC Residential Assistants static website. This proejct was created for the first project in the Full Stack Development Program at <a href="https://codeinstitute.net/global/" target="_blank">Code Institute</a>.

1. This web application first introduces the audience to the RA role, then the current team, and finally links to an application form for potential applicants. The home page lists carefully the job description of a residential assistant. It also links to the two other pages on the website, to promote engagement with the website. The Team page showcases each RA team member's profile picture, sorted in a 3 column gallery to keep picture width high. You can click on each picture to get a small pop-up which includes the name of the RA, their floor, and a short description of themselves. The pop-ups felt more interactive than having all descriptions on the page alongside the pictures, it would've overcrowded the page. Lastly, the application page is created as a standard form with each input having adequate restrictions on values i.e. no values above 4 for GPA input or a max word length for the text areas.

2. This website was mainly inspired by the Love Running website created in the course at Code Institute. It was mainly straightforward to follow.

3. In the future, I hope to add more interactive features for students to access their RAs more easily i.e. an appointment booking plug in or a complaints form. Moreover, a seperate sub-section of the website would be designated for RA use only (accesible through a log in and password). This sub-section would hold all necessary documents into iframes, and forms to fill out for RA documentation.

4. Credits:
I would like to thank the lovely people at Code Institute for curating two great learning modules for HTML and CSS. My mentor Sandeep for helping me brainstorm and debug. This link for great coding walkthrough on creating popups only with CSS <a href="https://codepad.co/snippet/popup-modal-made-with-css-no-javascript" target="_blank">Here</a>. Lastly, The great RA team who has been my source of inspiration and support for a while.
