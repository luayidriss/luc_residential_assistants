                Hola queridos!
My name is Antonio and as you might know, I’ll be the RA on the wholesome floor: Floor 5! Just as my last name and strong accent may suggest, I’m from Colombia. 
I really enjoy dancing salsa and other Latin music, as well as watching opera and listening to classical music. I love taking the time to listen to others, and give them my opinion as a good 19-year old “Grandpa”. I’m really looking forward to meeting you all and learning many things from all of you!
